- merge code from two branches A and main with no related commit histories between them:
{
    # firstly, commit all changes from the working branch (this case is A), then switch to the branch want to...
    # merge to (the branch is gonna be overwritted, this case is main), then run `git merge A --allow-unrelated-histories`,...
    # now the branch main has some merge conflicts that has to be resolved manually. To resolve the conflicts manually,...
    # can use vscode, open files with the conflicts in vscode and can see the conflicts via the UI of vscode (CodeLens),...
    # now can resolve the conflicts by do the steps in order: click on the button "Resolve in Merge Editor", click on...
    # "accept incoming", click on the button "Complete Merge". Now the conflicts in the file is resolved, then...
    # repeat those steps with other files until there is no conflicts left. OK done!

        $ git checkout main
        # Merge the branch A to branch main, the flag --allow-unrelated-histories force the merge to happen,...
        # then solve the merge conflicts
